## Technology Stack Overview

### Node.js
Node.js is a server-side JavaScript runtime that enables the execution of JavaScript code outside the browser. Known for its non-blocking, event-driven architecture, Node.js is particularly suitable for building scalable network applications and server-side functionalities. It uses an event-driven, asynchronous I/O model, making it efficient and well-suited for real-time applications.

### React
Developed and maintained by Facebook, React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It employs a component-based architecture, where UIs are broken down into modular, reusable components. React utilizes a virtual DOM to enhance performance by efficiently updating only the necessary components, providing a seamless and responsive user experience.

### Express.js
A minimalist and flexible web application framework for Node.js, Express.js simplifies the development of server-side applications and APIs. It offers a range of features, including middleware support for handling HTTP requests, routing for defining application endpoints, and templating engines for rendering dynamic content.

### npm (Node Package Manager)
The package manager for Node.js, npm allows developers to manage project dependencies, share and distribute code packages easily, and streamline the development process. It plays a crucial role in the Node.js ecosystem by providing access to a vast repository of open-source packages.

### Jest
A JavaScript testing framework developed by Facebook, Jest focuses on simplicity and efficiency. It is widely used for testing JavaScript code, providing features such as test isolation, snapshot testing, and parallel test execution. Jest is particularly known for its fast test execution and convenient testing utilities.

### HTML5
The fifth version of the Hypertext Markup Language, HTML5 introduces new elements and APIs that enhance the structure and functionality of web pages. It includes native support for multimedia elements, form validation, and semantic markup, contributing to a more feature-rich and accessible web.
